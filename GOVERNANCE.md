<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: Governance</h1>

This document describes how **The Lupaxa Project** is organised, maintained, and developed.
It outlines the decision-making model, roles, responsibilities, and expectations across the ecosystem.

The intent is to ensure consistent stewardship, transparency, and long-term sustainability across all of **The Lupaxa Project** repositories.

## 1. Project Scope

**The Lupaxa Project** maintains a wide range of tools across multiple organisations, please refer to the
[Projects Overview](https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/.github/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) for a complete list.

Governance processes and expectations are consistent across all of them.

## 2. Roles

### 2.1 Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Approving releases and tagging versions
- Ensuring code quality and security
- Coordinating major changes or refactors
- Enforcing project standards and documentation expectations

Maintainers have write access to relevant repositories.

### 2.2 Contributors

Contributors include anyone who:

- Submits pull requests
- Reports bugs
- Suggests improvements
- Contributes documentation or tests

Contributors do not need special permission.
All contributions are welcomed and reviewed on their merit.

### 2.3 Project Steward

**The Lupaxa Project** is overseen by a project steward responsible for:

- Setting direction and strategic priorities
- Maintaining consistency across all organisations
- Approving structural or cross-repository changes
- Managing organisation-wide assets such as reusable workflows
- Final decision-making when consensus cannot be reached

The steward is also responsible for resolving governance-level questions.

## 3. Decision Making

### 3.1 Everyday changes

Small changes (bug fixes, documentation, minor enhancements) follow a simple model:

1. A contributor opens a pull request.
2. A maintainer reviews it.
3. If approved and tests pass, the PR is merged.

### 3.2 Significant changes

Major changes — such as behaviour alterations, breaking changes, or new modules — require:

- A design discussion (issue or discussion thread)
- Agreement between maintainers
- Confirmation from the project steward if necessary

Decisions are made through lightweight consensus.
If consensus cannot be reached, the steward provides the final direction.

### 3.3 Security or critical issues

Security-related decisions follow the separate process defined in our [Security Policy](https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## 4. Repository Standards

All repositories within the ecosystem are expected to:

- Follow the shared [How to Contribute](https://github.com/the-lupaxa-projects/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
- Use the standard `.github` templates and guidelines
- Follow consistent release and versioning practices
- Maintain documentation that matches the project’s structure
- Use organisation-approved reusable GitHub workflows where applicable

These standards ensure consistency across more than 20 organisations.

## 5. Releases

Release processes vary by repository, but must follow:

- Semantic versioning wherever appropriate
- Clear change documentation (e.g. GitHub releases)
- Automated or reproducible build workflows
- Testing or validation appropriate for the tool’s purpose

Major releases or cross-repository changes should be announced or documented clearly.

## 6. Adding or Removing Maintainers

Maintainers may be added when:

- They consistently contribute valuable work
- They demonstrate understanding of the project standards
- They show responsible judgement and collaboration

Maintainers may be removed if:

- They become inactive for extended periods
- They violate project policies
- They request removal

Any maintainer changes should be communicated clearly within the relevant repositories.

## 7. Conflict Resolution

For technical disagreements:

1. Discuss the issue openly on GitHub.
2. Seek consensus between maintainers.
3. If unresolved, the project steward provides a final decision.

For interpersonal conflicts, the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/the-lupaxa-projects/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) takes precedence.

## 8. Amendments to Governance

This document evolves as the project grows.
Changes may be proposed via pull request, and require:

- Review by maintainers
- Approval by the project steward for final confirmation
