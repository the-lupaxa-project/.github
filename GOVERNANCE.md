<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: Governance</h1>

**The Lupaxa Project** is coordinated through organisation-wide governance designed to ensure transparent decision-making, fairness,
and long-term sustainability across all repositories and organisations within the ecosystem.

The central governance documentation is maintained here: [The Lupaxa Project: Governance][1]

[1]: https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/governance

This document covers:

- How decisions are proposed, discussed, and approved
- Governance roles and responsibilities
- How projects join, transition, or retire within the ecosystem

These organisation-wide governance rules apply across **The Lupaxa Project** as a whole.
