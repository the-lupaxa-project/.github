<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: <em>.github</em> Repository</h1>

This repository provides the central entry point to **The Lupaxa Project**. It introduces the ecosystem, links to organisation-wide documentation,
and defines the shared standards that apply across all Lupaxa organisations and repositories.

These resources ensure consistent, secure, and maintainable practices across the entire project portfolio.

<h2>Organisation-Wide Documentation</h2>

These core policies and standards are maintained in dedicated repositories:

<h2>Role of This Repository</h2>

This repository:

- Presents the organisation to contributors and users
- Acts as the root directory for global information
- Ensures that all Lupaxa organisations link to the same standards
- Supports editors, maintainers, and automation workflows

Individual repositories may include local overrides or additions — but should always reference these global standards where appropriate.

<h2>Labels and Issue Management</h2>

We maintain a consistent label taxonomy across the ecosystem for:

- Impact classification
- Resolution state
- Issue lifecycle
- Feature and bug types
- Dependency management and automation

These conventions improve triage, reporting clarity, and long-term maintainability.

Details are documented in the central contributing guide.

<h2>Security by Design</h2>

Security is designed into every layer of **The Lupaxa Project**:

- Signed commits are required for all contributions
- Workflows operate with least privilege by default
- Reusable workflows include input validation and guardrails
- Vulnerability reporting follows a standard automated procedure

Security requirements are detailed in the central security policy.

<h2>Governance and Quality Assurance</h2>

All of **The Lupaxa Project** organisations follow consistent rules for:

- Code quality and review policies
- Documentation expectations
- Testing, versioning, and release processes
- Lifecycle management for features, issues, and repositories
- Automation safety and permissions

These principles ensure predictability, fairness, and technical excellence across the entire project.
