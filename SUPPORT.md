<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: Getting Support</h1>

**The Lupaxa Project** provides open-source tools across multiple repositories and organisations.
This document describes how to seek help, report issues, and request improvements.

## Before Opening an Issue

Please check the following first:

- The project’s `README.md`
- Any documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Existing issues and pull requests
- Discussions

Many common questions are already addressed there.

## Getting Help

For general questions about using a tool, configuration, behaviour, or expected output, you may open an issue using the **"Question"** template (if available).
Keep questions concise and focused.

## Reporting Bugs

If you believe you have found a bug:

1. Open an issue using the **Bug Report** template.
2. Include clear reproduction steps.
3. Provide details such as:
   - Tool version or Git SHA
   - Operating system and environment
   - Expected behaviour
   - Actual behaviour
   - Relevant logs or tracebacks

Reproducible reports make problem resolution significantly faster.

## Requesting Features

Feature requests are welcome!

Please provide:

- A clear description of the feature
- The use case or problem it solves
- Any examples, mockups, or alternative ideas
- Why it belongs in this project rather than external tooling

Not all requests will be implemented, but all will be considered.

## Security Issues

Do not report security issues publicly.
Instead, follow the guidance in the organisation-wide [Security Policy](https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

We take security seriously and will respond promptly and privately.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute code or documentation, please first read the organisation-wide
[How to Contribute](https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for expectations, workflow, and standards.

These documents explain how repositories are grouped, who is responsible for
them, and how decisions are made across the ecosystem.

## General Questions

For questions that are not bugs, not feature requests, and not security issues, please:

- Open a Discussion, or
- Open a Question issue using our issue templates

General questions about how to use the tools or how they work internally are always welcome.

## Project Scope

**The Lupaxa Project** maintains a wide range of tools across multiple organisations, please refer to the
[Projects Overview](https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/.github/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) for a complete list.

Support processes and expectations are consistent across all of them.

## Community

We appreciate all contributions—code, documentation, testing, feedback, or simply using the tools.
Your involvement helps shape the future of **The Lupaxa Project**.
