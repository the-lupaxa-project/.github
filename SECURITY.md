<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: Security Policy</h1>

**The Lupaxa Project** follows a security-by-design approach, supported by a unified vulnerability reporting and assessment process that ensures
issues are handled responsibly, privately, and efficiently across all repositories and organisations.

The central security policy is maintained here: [The Lupaxa Project: Security Process][1]

[1]: https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/security

This document covers:

- How to privately report vulnerabilities
- Required information for security submissions
- How disclosures are managed and communicated

These organisation-wide security requirements apply across **The Lupaxa Project** as a whole.
