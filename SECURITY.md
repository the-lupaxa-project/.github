    The Lupaxa Project 🐺: Security Policy
</h1>

<h2>
    Overview
</h2>

The Lupaxa Project follows a **Security by Design** philosophy across all open-source and internal projects.
We take vulnerabilities seriously and deeply value responsible disclosure from the community.

We believe that transparency, collaboration, and defensive design are essential for maintaining trust in open source.

    Reporting a Vulnerability
</h2>

If you discover a potential security issue:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue or pull request.
2. **Email us directly:** [security@thelupaxaproject.org](mailto:security@thelupaxaproject.org)
   - This address is hosted on **Proton Mail**, providing end-to-end encryption by default.
   - You do **not** need to use GPG or provide a public key.
   - If you also use Proton Mail, messages are encrypted automatically.
3. In your report, please include:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested mitigations

We aim to acknowledge receipt within **48 hours** and provide regular updates until the issue is resolved.

<h2 style="border: none; padding-bottom: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 600;">
    Scope
</h2>

This policy covers:

- All public repositories under **The Lupaxa Project** organization
- Related Docker images, GitHub Actions, and published packages
  (PyPI, RubyGems, Crates.io, npm, and others)

If you are unsure whether a project is in scope, please ask — we will confirm.

    Our Commitments
</h2>

- We aim to triage and verify all valid reports within **five business days**.
- A fix or mitigation plan will be communicated before public disclosure.
- Credit will be given to reporters who follow responsible disclosure practices.
- We will work collaboratively to ensure any identified risks are resolved quickly and transparently.

    Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
</h2>

We ask that you:

- Avoid exploiting or publicly sharing vulnerabilities before a fix is available.
- Do not access or modify data that is not your own.
- Provide enough technical detail to help us reproduce the issue safely.

Following these principles helps us maintain a secure environment for everyone who uses our projects.
