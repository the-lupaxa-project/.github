### 🧭 Overview
We welcome contributions of all kinds — whether it’s fixing a bug, improving documentation, or adding new functionality.  

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements, or would like to propose new features, please open an issue in the relevant repository or submit a pull request.

Please follow the guidelines below when doing so.

### 🐛 Issue Reporting

Before submitting an issue:

- 🔍 **Check for duplicates** — search existing issues to ensure it hasn’t already been reported.  
- 🧩 **Check the latest code** — the issue may already be fixed.  
- 🧠 **Be clear and concise** — describe the problem precisely and completely.  
- 🧾 **Use a descriptive title** — fill in all issue form fields in complete sentences.  
- 🧪 **Include details** — specify the version, environment, or configuration used.  
- 💻 **Provide examples** — minimal code samples or reproduction steps help us diagnose faster.

### 💡 Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement that you’d like to see but don’t plan to implement yourself, please open an issue using the **Feature Request** template.  

Explain *why* the feature is valuable and include use cases or examples where possible.

### 🔁 Pull Requests

- 📖 Read [How to Properly Contribute to Open Source Projects on GitHub][1].  
- 🌿 Fork the project and create a **feature branch** (not `main` or `master`).  
- ✍️ Write [Good Commit Messages][2].  
- 🧩 Follow existing **code style, documentation, and testing conventions**.  
- 🧪 Include or update tests for any new code.  
- ✅ Ensure all tests pass before submission.  
- 🔄 [Squash Related Commits Together][3] before opening your PR.  
- 🧾 Open a [Pull Request][4] focused on a single, clear change — with a descriptive title and full sentences.

> **Note:** We reserve the right to request changes or reject pull requests that don’t meet these standards.  
> We will always provide constructive feedback to help you align with our practices.

### 🔐 Signed Commits

All commits **must be GPG- or SSH-signed** to verify the developer’s identity.  
Unsigned commits will be rejected automatically.

To sign your commits:

```bash
git commit -S -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```
