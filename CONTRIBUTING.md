    The Lupaxa Project 🐺: How to Contribute
</h1>

<h2>
    Overview
</h2>

We welcome contributions of all kinds — whether it’s fixing a bug, improving documentation, or adding new functionality.

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements, or would like to propose new features, please open an issue in the relevant repository or submit a pull request.

Please follow the guidelines below when doing so.

<h2>
    Issue Reporting
</h2>

Before submitting an issue:

- **Check for duplicates** — search existing issues to ensure it hasn’t already been reported.
- **Check the latest code** — the issue may already be fixed.
- **Be clear and concise** — describe the problem precisely and completely.
- **Use a descriptive title** — fill in all issue form fields in complete sentences.
- **Include details** — specify the version, environment, or configuration used.
- **Provide examples** — minimal code samples or reproduction steps help us diagnose faster.

<h2>
    Feature Requests
</h2>

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement that you’d like to see but don’t plan to implement yourself, please open an issue using the **Feature Request** template.

Explain *why* the feature is valuable and include use cases or examples where possible.

<h2>
    Pull Requests
</h2>
