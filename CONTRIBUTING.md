<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: How to Contribute</h1>

**The Lupaxa Project** uses a shared set of contribution guidelines to ensure a consistent development and collaboration experience across
all repositories and organisations. These guidelines promote clarity, quality, and fairness in how we work together.

The central contributing guide is maintained here: [The Lupaxa Project: How to Contribute][1]

[1]: https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/contributing

This document covers:

- Issue reporting and feature request expectations
- Development workflows and code review requirements
- Commit, branch, and release conventions

These organisation-wide contribution requirements apply across **The Lupaxa Project** as a whole.
