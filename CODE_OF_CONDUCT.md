    The Lupaxa Project: Code of Conduct
</h3>

<hr style="width: 50%; height: 1px; margin: 1em auto 0.5em;">

### Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in **The Lupaxa Project** a welcoming, harassment-free, and respectful experience for everyone —
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open and collaborative community built on empathy, mutual respect, and constructive dialogue.
Every interaction within our projects should reflect the same principles we value in our code — **clarity, integrity, and purpose**.

### Our Standards

#### Examples of positive behaviour include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting differing opinions, experiences, and perspectives
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the project and its community
- Recognizing and valuing each contributor’s effort and expertise

#### Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
- Trolling, excessive negativity, or sustained disruption
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without consent

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and for taking fair, consistent action in response to any violations.

They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct,
and may temporarily or permanently ban contributors whose behaviour violates these standards.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project team at:
**[conduct@thelupaxaproject.org](mailto:conduct@thelupaxaproject.org)**

All complaints will be reviewed promptly, investigated confidentially, and resolved as quickly as possible.
The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter at all times.

### Enforcement Guidelines

To maintain fairness and transparency, violations will generally result in one of the following actions:

1. **Warning** — Written notice outlining the violation and expectations for correction.
2. **Temporary Ban** — Restricted participation for a defined period.
3. **Permanent Ban** — Removal from all related projects and community spaces.

Severity, frequency, and intent will be considered when determining the appropriate response.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html),
with modifications for **The Lupaxa Project’s** open-source and security-first philosophy.
