<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: Code of Conduct</h1>

**The Lupaxa Project** maintains a single organisation-wide Code of Conduct that applies to every project, community space, and event
within the ecosystem. It defines expected behaviours, unacceptable conduct, and how concerns are handled to ensure a safe and welcoming
environment for all.

The central Code of Conduct is maintained here: [The Lupaxa Project: Code of Conduct][1]

[1]: https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/code-of-conduct

This document covers:

- Expected respectful and inclusive behaviour
- Prohibited conduct and enforcement standards
- How to report concerns privately or publicly

These organisation-wide conduct expectations apply across **The Lupaxa Project** as a whole.
