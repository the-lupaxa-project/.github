<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: Maintainers</h1>

This document lists the maintainers of **The Lupaxa Project** and outlines the expectations and responsibilities associated with maintaining repositories within the ecosystem.

The intent is to provide clarity, transparency, and consistency across all Lupaxa organisations and tools.

For the full governance model and decision-making process, see [Governance][1]

[1]: https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/.github/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md.

## 1. Current Maintainers

### Project Steward

| Name     | Role                              | GitHub                                   |
| :------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Lupraxus | Project Steward / Lead Maintainer | [@Lupraxus](https://github.com/Lupraxus) |

The Project Steward oversees the direction and coherence of the overall ecosystem.

### Additional Maintainers

At present, there are no additional maintainers formally assigned.
Contributions from the community are welcome, and future maintainers may be added as the project grows.

## 2. Responsibilities of Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Ensuring code quality, testing, and security standards
- Overseeing CI/CD workflows and release processes
- Managing documentation and repository structure
- Coordinating improvements and issue triage
- Upholding the Code of Conduct and project values

Specific responsibilities may vary by repository.

## 3. Expectations

Maintainers are expected to:

- Provide timely reviews wherever possible
- Communicate clearly about decisions or required changes
- Avoid blocking contributions without explanation
- Maintain consistency with project style, structure, and standards
- Prioritise project stability and quality

Communication is primarily through GitHub Issues, Discussions, and Pull Requests.

## 4. Decision Making

Maintainers should aim for lightweight consensus.
For major changes or disagreements, see [Governance](https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/.github/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md), which describes the decision-making model and escalation path.

The Project Steward has final decision authority when consensus cannot be reached.

## 5. Becoming a Maintainer

New maintainers may be added based on:

- A history of consistent, high-quality contributions
- Demonstrated understanding of project design and standards
- Positive collaboration with other contributors
- A willingness to take on long-term responsibility

Candidates may be nominated by the Project Steward or existing maintainers.

## 6. Stepping Down

Maintainers may step down at any time by:

- Opening an issue or discussion outlining their intention
- Handing over responsibilities if needed

Maintainership may also lapse if:

- A maintainer becomes inactive for an extended period
- Responsibilities are no longer being met
- Behaviour conflicts with the Code of Conduct

Any changes will be communicated clearly.
