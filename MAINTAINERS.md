<h1 align="center">The Lupaxa Project: Maintainers</h1>

**The Lupaxa Project** centrally manages maintainer responsibilities, expectations, and appointments to ensure accountability, clarity,
and continuity across the entire ecosystem. This approach guarantees clear ownership and consistent stewardship for every repository.

The central maintainers documentation is maintained here: [The Lupaxa Project: Maintainer][1]

[1]: https://github.com/the-lupaxa-project/maintainer

This document covers:

- How maintainers are selected, transitioned, or retired
- Defined responsibilities and authority levels
- Contact guidance for individual areas and repositories

These organisation-wide maintainer responsibilities apply across **The Lupaxa Project** as a whole.
